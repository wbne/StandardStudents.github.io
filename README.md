What is Standard Students?
Standard Students is a podcast hosted by Prydt and wbne mainly about their high school experience and along with it, some other less interesting boring life stuff.

Why should I listen to this show?
Not only does this podcast have two incredibly "witty" and "intelligent" hosts, it might also make your life seem much more interesting, afterall, we're still in high school.

Who are you?
I'm an eagle.
